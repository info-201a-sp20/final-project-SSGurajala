## Why are you interested in this field/domain?

While infectious diseases have the potential to bring about acute suffering (as seen currently with COVID-19), many of the greatest killers in American history, especially in the past couple of decades, have been non-infectious chronic diseases brought about by poor lifestyle choices. We want to analyze data about this field to better understand how these diseases are brought about and how they might be prevented. 

## What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain?

http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/burden-disease-spain-results-global-burden-disease-2016
This project utilized data collected from Spain and picked the year 2016; they then analyzed disease burden of 333 diseases and injuries as well as 84 risk factors. They then analyzed the trends for disability life years, mortality, risk factors etc.

Authors of this project used disability adjusted life years across both sexes, 291 causes, 20 age groups, and 187 countries to estimate general population health in 21 regions for the years 1990, 2005 and 2010.

Authors of this project used results from the 2016 global burden of diseases study to find healthy life expectancy and disability-adjusted life years and compared them to the social demographic index, a measurement of general prosperity, fertility, and education, globally. 

## What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain?

How does income level/financial stability track with disease burden globally? We want to use the dataset's metric of social demographic index, SDI, to determine income level and general prosperity and pair that with disability adjusted lifeyears and years of life lost to disease data to see if/how these two things correlate.  

How does disease burden differ between cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and neoplasms globally? We want to use the metrics of disability adjusted life years and years of life lost to disease to assess disease burden of each disease at the data's most current time, 2017, and do comparative analyses between the results for each of these diseases. 

How can we prevent unnecessary non-infectious diseases from occuring as often in the future?

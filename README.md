# Final Project Brainstorm

## Domain of Interest

### Why are you interested in this field/domain?

While infectious diseases have the potential to bring about acute suffering (as seen currently with COVID-19), many of the greatest killers in American history, especially in the past couple of decades, have been non-infectious chronic diseases brought about by poor lifestyle choices. We want to analyze data about this field to better understand how these diseases are brought about and how they might be prevented.

### What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain?

[The burden of disease in Spain: Results from the Global Burden of Disease 2016](http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/burden-disease-spain-results-global-burden-disease-2016)

This project utilized data collected from Spain and picked the year 2016; they then analyzed disease burden of 333 diseases and injuries as well as 84 risk factors. They then analyzed the trends for disability life years, mortality, risk factors etc.  

[Disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs) for 291 diseases and injuries in 21 regions, 1990–2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010](http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/disability%E2%80%90adjusted-life-years-dalys-291-diseases-and-injuries-21-regions-1990%E2%80%932010)

Authors of this project used disability adjusted life years across both sexes, 291 causes, 20 age groups, and 187 countries to estimate general population health in 21 regions for the years 1990, 2005 and 2010.

[Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 333 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016](http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-regional-and-national-disability-adjusted-life-years-dalys-333-diseases-and)

Authors of this project used results from the 2016 global burden of diseases study to find healthy life expectancy and disability-adjusted life years and compared them to the social demographic index, a measurement of general prosperity, fertility, and education, globally.

### What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain?

**How does income level/financial stability track with disease burden globally?**

We want to use the dataset's metric of social demographic index, SDI, to determine income level and general prosperity and pair that with disability adjusted lifeyears, years of life lost to disease, and mortality data to see trends in disease burden and prosperity.  

**How does disease burden differ between cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and neoplasms globally?**

We want to use the metrics of disability adjusted life years, years of life lost to disease, and mortality data to assess disease burden of each disease at the data's most current time, 2017, and do comparative analyses between the results for each of these diseases.

**How does disease burden for cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and neoplasms change over time?**

We want to track disease burden over time by analyzing changes in disability adjusted life years, years of life lost, and mortality data for each of these diseases over the period 1990 to 2017.

## Finding Data

### Neoplasms data set
Data URL: http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool

This data was taken from the GHDx data selecting tool for the 2017 IHME Global Burden of Disease Study; this data was generated via compilation of various neoplasm related publication data sets and mortality and other health metric data released by individual countries.

- Observations (rows): 155988
- Features (columns): 10

This data set can be used to answer how neoplasm disease burden tracks with income level/financial stability, to determine how neoplasm disease burden differs from cardiovascular disease burden and respiratory disease burden, and how disease burden for cardiovascular disease changes over time.

### cardiovascular data set
Data URL: http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool

This data was also taken from the GHDX data selecting tool from the 2017 Global Burden of Disease Study; the GBD generated this data by compiling data from the WHO mortality data base as well as other academic sources.

- Observations (rows): 155988
- Features (columns): 10

This data set can be used to answer how cardiovascular disease burden has changed over time, how it differs from disease burden for respiratory disease and neoplasms, and it tracks with general prosperity globally.

### chronic respiratory disease data set
Data URL: http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool

This dataset was taken from the GDHX data selecting tool from the 2017 Global Burden of Disease Study; these data were generated from compiling sources like the WHO Mortality Data Sets, academic publications, and data releases from individual countries health ministries and related institutions.

- Observations (rows): 155988
- Features (columns): 10

We can use this data set to see how chronic respiratory disease burden differs from disease burden for cardiovascular disease and neoplasms geographically, how it tracks with the SDI of countries, and how it has changed over the time period specified in the data set.
